Label iQ Architecture - Speaker Notes that explain the diagram 

Opening (Header) 

"This is Label iQ - an AI-powered FDA drug label assistant built for the Denodo Hackathon 2025. Let me walk you through our five-layer architecture." 

 

1. User Roles Section 

"We support three distinct user roles with different access levels: 

Patients get simplified, safe information - they can access 8 of our 9 database views 

Physicians get full clinical access to all 9 views 

Judges - that's you - get everything plus visibility into the actual SQL queries being generated 

This demonstrates real-world healthcare RBAC - Role-Based Access Control." 

 

2. Presentation Layer (Frontend) 

"Our frontend is a React single-page application built with TypeScript. 

Key highlights: 

TanStack Query manages all our server state and caching 

Shadcn/UI gives us accessible, production-ready components 

The chat interface streams responses in real-time 

RBAC filtering hides sensitive UI elements based on your role 

The code snippet shows our actual API integration pattern." 

 

3. Data Flow - Frontend to Backend 

"All communication happens over HTTPS with TLS 1.3 encryption. We POST JSON payloads to our chat endpoint." 

 

4. API Layer (Express.js) 

"Our Node.js backend handles three critical functions: 

Zod validation sanitizes all input to prevent injection attacks 

Session management tracks user roles 

Response filtering transforms technical content into patient-friendly language 

The RBAC matrix shows exactly what each role can access. Notice patients cannot see the master_safety_risk view - that contains technical risk assessments meant for healthcare providers." 

 

5. Data Flow - Backend to Denodo 

"We use Basic Authentication to connect to Denodo, passing an allowed views list that enforces our RBAC policy. The AI SDK translates natural language into SQL." 

 

6. AI Orchestration Layer (Denodo AI SDK) 

"This is where the magic happens. The Denodo AI SDK runs as a microservice on AWS EC2. 

 

Three key metrics: 

RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation pipeline 

200K token context window - can handle complex medical documents 

The SDK uses query decomposition to break complex questions into sub-queries, ChromaDB for semantic vector search, and custom prompt engineering for FDA-specific responses. 

 

Under the hood, it's calling Claude 3.5 Sonnet on AWS Bedrock." 

7. Data Virtualization Layer (Denodo Agora) 

"Finally, our data layer. The source data is stored in an AWS S3 bucket, and Denodo Agora virtualizes it through our labeliq database.” 

We have 9 specialized views covering different aspects of drug labels: 

Drug identity and purpose 

Clinical pharmacology 

Dosing instructions 

Drug interactions 

Safety risks (restricted for patients) 

Overdose emergencies 

Product indexing 

Special populations 

Storage handling 

The yellow note highlights an important architectural decision: since Agora is a managed service, we couldn't create custom database users. So we implemented app-level RBAC that validates the tables_used metadata after each response. This is actually a common pattern in production healthcare applications." 

 

8. Architecture Decision Records (Green Panel) 

"We documented our key decisions: 

 

Why Denodo AI SDK? - Production microservice pattern, manages 200+ Python dependencies, isolates AWS credentials 

Why App-Level RBAC? - Agora's managed service limitations, plus post-response validation 

Security - TLS everywhere, input validation, environment variable secrets" 

 

Closing (Footer Stats) 

"In summary: 13 drug labels, 9 database views, 3 user roles, 5 architectural layers - all working together to make FDA drug information accessible through natural language." 

 

May want to mention – It is SLOW! 

The 45-60 second response time reflects the quality and thoroughness of the AI - it's decomposing your question, searching the vector database, generating SQL, retrieving data from Denodo Agora, and synthesizing an accurate medical response. We prioritize accuracy over speed when it comes to healthcare information. 

Step 

Time 

What It Does 

1. Query Decomposition 

~5s 

AI breaks your question into sub-queries 

2. Vector Search 

~5s 

ChromaDB searches for relevant metadata 

3. SQL Generation 

~10s 

LLM generates SQL from natural language 

4. Denodo Query 

~15s 

SQL executes against Agora, data retrieved 

5. LLM Response 

~15s 

Claude synthesizes answer from retrieved data 

6. Network Overhead 

~5s 

Replit → EC2 → Bedrock → Agora round trips
