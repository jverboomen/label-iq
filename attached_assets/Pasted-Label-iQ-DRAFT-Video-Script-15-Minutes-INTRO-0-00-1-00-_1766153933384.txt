Label iQ – DRAFT Video Script (15 Minutes) 

INTRO (0:00 - 1:00) 

[Screen: Title slide with Label iQ logo] 

"Hi, I'm Brian O’Donnell from Massive Insights, and I'm excited to present Label iQ - an AI-powered FDA drug label assistant built for the Denodo Data Virtualization Hackathon 2025. 

In the next 15 minutes, I'll show you how we combined Denodo's data virtualization with generative AI to make complex medical information accessible to everyone - from patients to physicians."

THE PROBLEM (1:00 - 2:30) 

[Screen: Show an actual FDA drug label - dense text] 

"FDA drug labels are critical documents. They contain everything a doctor or patient needs to know about a medication - dosing, interactions, warnings, side effects. 

But there's a problem. These labels are: 

Dense and technical - written for pharmacists, not patients 

Scattered across dozens of sections - good luck finding what you need quickly 

Impossible to query - you can't just ask 'Does this drug interact with aspirin?' 

Patients struggle to understand their medications. Doctors waste time searching through documentation. 

We asked: What if you could just ask a question in plain English and get an accurate answer?" 

Shape 

THE SOLUTION (2:30 - 4:00) 

[Screen: Show Label iQ home page] 

"That's Label iQ. 

It's a conversational AI chatbot that lets you ask questions about FDA drug labels in natural language. Click on a drug, ask your question, and get a clear, accurate answer sourced directly from official FDA data. 

Three key innovations: 

Natural language interface - Ask questions like 'What is ENTRESTO used for?' or 'Can I take ELIQUIS with aspirin?' 

Role-based access control - Different users see different information. Patients get simplified, safe answers. Physicians get full clinical details. This reflects real-world healthcare information governance. 

Powered by Denodo - All our data comes from Denodo Agora. We're not copying data anywhere - we're virtualizing access to FDA label information through 9 specialized database views."

LIVE DEMO - PATIENT ROLE (4:00 - 7:00) 

[Screen: Live app - select Patient role] 

"Let me show you how it works. I'll start as a Patient. 

The password is simply 'patient' - lowercase. This is a demo, so we're using honor-system authentication. 

[Login as Patient] 

Now I see the main interface. Notice the grid of 14 drug logos - these are all the FDA labels in our database. I can click any drug to start a conversation. 

[Click ENTRESTO logo] 

The system auto-populates a question: 'What is ENTRESTO used for?' 

[Send the message] 

You'll notice this takes about 45-60 seconds. That's because the AI is doing a lot of work behind the scenes: 

Decomposing my question into sub-queries 

Searching a vector database for relevant content 

Generating SQL to query Denodo Agora 

Retrieving data from 9 different views 

Having Claude 3.5 Sonnet synthesize a response 

This isn't slow - it's thorough. We prioritize accuracy over speed when it comes to healthcare information. 

[Show response] 

There's our answer - written in patient-friendly language. Notice the metadata: the AI model used, response time, and which database tables were accessed. 

As a patient, I cannot see the raw SQL query - that's hidden for my role."

LIVE DEMO - PHYSICIAN ROLE (7:00 - 8:30) 

[Screen: Switch to Physician role] 

"Now let me switch to Physician. Password is 'physician'. 

[Login as Physician] 

Same interface, but now I have access to all 9 database views - including master_safety_risk, which contains technical risk assessments meant for healthcare providers. 

[Ask about drug interactions] 

Let me ask about drug interactions: 'Does ELIQUIS interact with aspirin?' 

[Wait for response] 

The physician gets more clinical detail in the response. Still no SQL visibility - that's reserved for judges." 

Shape 

LIVE DEMO - JUDGE ROLE (8:30 - 10:00) 

[Screen: Switch to Judge role] 

"Finally, the Judge role - that's you! Password is 'judge'. 

[Login as Judge] 

As a judge, you see everything. Full access to all views, plus the actual SQL queries being generated. 

[Ask a question] 

Let me ask: 'What are the dosing instructions for JARDIANCE?' 

[Show response with SQL] 

There's the answer. But look - now you can see the SQL query that was generated. This demonstrates the power of Denodo AI SDK: it's translating natural language into SQL that queries our virtualized data layer. 

You can also see our Query History panel - every question asked in this session."

ARCHITECTURE DEEP DIVE (10:00 - 12:30) 

[Screen: Show architecture diagram] 

"Let me walk you through the architecture. Label iQ uses a five-layer microservice design. 

Layer 1: Presentation Layer 

React frontend with TypeScript 

TanStack Query for state management 

Shadcn/UI components with FDA-inspired design 

Layer 2: API Layer 

Express.js backend 

Zod validation on all inputs - prevents injection attacks 

Role-based access control enforcement 

Layer 3: AI Orchestration 

Denodo AI SDK running on AWS EC2 

This is a microservice pattern - the AI SDK is a separate, scalable service 

It manages 200+ Python dependencies and its own AWS credentials 

Layer 4: Large Language Model 

Claude 3.5 Sonnet on AWS Bedrock 

200,000 token context window - handles complex medical documents 

Layer 5: Data Virtualization 

Denodo Agora with our labeliq database 

9 specialized views covering different aspects of drug labels 

SQL over JDBC with basic authentication 

One key architectural decision: since Denodo Agora is a managed service, we couldn't create custom database users. So we implemented application-level RBAC that validates the tables_used metadata after each response. This is actually a common pattern in production healthcare applications."

DATA MODEL (12:30 - 13:30) 

[Screen: Show database views table] 

"Our data model consists of 9 virtualized views in Denodo Agora: 

drug_purpose_and_identity - Basic drug information 

clinical_pharmacology - How the drug works 

dosing_and_administration - Dosage instructions 

interactions - Drug-drug and drug-food interactions 

overdose_emergency - Emergency treatment info 

product_and_label_index - Label metadata 

specific_population - Pediatric, geriatric, pregnancy info 

storage_and_handling - Storage requirements 

master_safety_risk - Technical risk assessments (restricted) 

Patients can access 8 of these views. The master_safety_risk view is restricted because it contains technical risk assessments that should be interpreted by a healthcare provider. 

We have 14 drugs in our database - major brand-name medications like ENTRESTO, ELIQUIS, JARDIANCE, HUMIRA, and more." 

Shape 

SECURITY & COMPLIANCE (13:30 - 14:00) 

[Screen: Security features slide] 

"Quick note on security: 

TLS 1.3 encryption on all connections 

Zod schema validation prevents injection attacks 

Credential isolation - app and AI SDK have separate credentials 

Post-response validation - we verify only allowed views were accessed 

This architecture is designed for healthcare compliance - protecting sensitive medical information at every layer." 

Shape 

FUTURE ROADMAP (14:00 - 14:30) 

[Screen: Future enhancements slide] 

"Where could this go next? 

openFDA API integration - access 170,000+ drug labels 

ClinicalTrials.gov - connect to clinical trial data 

Drug pricing data - help patients understand costs 

Multi-language support - Spanish and other languages 

Voice interface - accessibility for visually impaired users 

The beauty of Denodo's virtualization is that we can add new data sources without changing the application."

CLOSING (14:30 - 15:00) 

[Screen: Final slide with key stats] 

"To summarize: Label iQ demonstrates how Denodo's data virtualization, combined with modern generative AI, can transform access to critical healthcare information. 

14 drug labels 

9 database views 

3 user roles 

5 architectural layers 

All working together to answer one simple question: What do I need to know about my medication? 

Thank you for your time. I'm Brian O’Donnell from Team Massive Insights, and this has been Label iQ."
