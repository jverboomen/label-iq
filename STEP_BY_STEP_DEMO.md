## Step 7: View the AI Response

The AI response appears in a white bubble on the left with:

**Response Content:**

**For Judge Role Only:**
- "SQL Query" section (password-protected with "denodo")
- Shows the actual SQL generated by the AI

---

## Step 8: Ask Follow-up Questions

### For AI Features:
- "Powered by AWS Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet"
- "Maintains conversation context for follow-up questions"

### For RBAC:
- "Patient role filters sensitive technical assessments"
- "Physician role has full data access"
- "Judge role can inspect the generated SQL queries"

## Troubleshooting

**Slow response?**
- First query to a drug may take longer (cold start)
- Normal response time: 45-60 seconds
- If response comes in 3-6 seconds, it may be a rejection (try rephrasing)

**Login failed?**
- Passwords are case-sensitive
- Must match exactly: patient/physician/judge

**No response?**
- Check if AI SDK is running on AWS EC2
- Response time > 90 seconds may indicate timeout
