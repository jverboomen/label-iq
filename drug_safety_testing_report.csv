Summary Statistics:
Total Drugs Tested: 14
Total Safety Queries: 28 (14 pregnancy + 14 grapefruit)

Pregnancy Question Results:
- Drugs with detailed pregnancy information: 3 (JARDIANCE, JAKAFI, Imbruvica)
- Drugs with limited/no pregnancy data: 11
- Success rate for pregnancy queries: 21.4%

Grapefruit Interaction Results:
- Critical interactions found: 1 (Imbruvica - AVOID GRAPEFRUIT)
- No interaction or no data: 13
- Success rate for identifying interactions: 7.1%

Key Findings:
1. Imbruvica successfully identified critical grapefruit interaction (medically accurate and important)
2. Three drugs (JARDIANCE, JAKAFI, Imbruvica) consistently provide better safety information
3. Limited pregnancy data suggests this information may be in restricted database views or different label sections
4. System successfully protects patients with RBAC warnings when accessing technical safety assessments
5. Response quality varies by drug - likely due to database schema and available label sections

Recommendations:
- Consider expanding database views to include more pregnancy/lactation sections
- Monitor which drugs consistently lack safety data and investigate database coverage
- The system correctly identifies critical drug interactions when data is available
- Patient-facing disclaimer system working as intended for technical data access
